# hello-world
This is my first code in GitHub.
So hello humans! I hope you people are fine!
I am Kaustav.

I have just statrted to learn coding. Github seemed interesting, that's why I logged in here. My english isn't that good. I hope that doesn;t bother you. If there are spelling, grammatical errors, please ignore. I love computer science. I want to become a coder when i grow up.
